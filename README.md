# Agentic QWASP Top 10 Assessment Framework

A defensive, agent-based framework for orchestrating authorized web application
security assessments aligned to the OWASP Top 10.

## Purpose

This project demonstrates how specialized AI agents can coordinate a penetration
test workflow for an application you own or have explicit authorization to test.

The framework focuses on:
- Asset discovery
- Authentication review
- Configuration review
- Input validation testing
- Dependency inventory
- Evidence collection
- Report generation

## Agent Architecture

1. ReconAgent
2. AuthAgent
3. InputValidationAgent
4. DependencyAgent
5. ConfigurationAgent
6. EvidenceAgent
7. ReportAgent

## OWASP Coverage

- A01: Broken Access Control
- A02: Cryptographic Failures
- A03: Injection
- A04: Insecure Design
- A05: Security Misconfiguration
- A06: Vulnerable and Outdated Components
- A07: Identification and Authentication Failures
- A08: Software and Data Integrity Failures
- A09: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
- A10: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

## Usage
